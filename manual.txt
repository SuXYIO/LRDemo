NAME
	LRDemo (Linear Regression Demo)
	Version 1.0.0

SYNOPSIS
	./LR [args]

DESCRIPTION
	Linear regression demo made with C standard libs.

OPTIONS
	-V	Verbose mode, prints values of vars every iteration.

	-s [seed]	Define seed, use the seed to generate random, can duplicate run. If not enabled, the program will seed using time (timestamp * nsec).

	-f [filename]	Write info per iteration to a file, in CSV format. Creates one if file doesn't exist, ask if overwrite if it does.

	-A [funcnum]	Define which activation function to use, 0 is default.
		funcnum:
			0: None
			1: ReLU
			2: LeakyReLU
			3: Sigmoid
			4: Tanh

	-L [funcnum]	Define which loss function to use, 0 is default.
		funcnum:
			0: MSE

	-E [maxepochs]	Define how many epochs to stop training. If this is set, -l is ignored, otherwise use -l.

	-b [batchsize]	Define how large is one batch (batch_size), 256 is default.

	-e [eta]	Define eta (learning rate), 0.001 is default.

	-l [expectedloss]	Define expected loss, the training ends when loss < expectedloss, 0.001 is default.

	-n [noisefactor]	Define the noise factor for data neuron g(x), which is multiplied with a standard normal distribution as noise, 0 is default.
	
	-v	Print version info.

	-h	Help (manual) page, prints this manual.
