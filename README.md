# LRDemo

## Intro

Linear regression demo made with C standard & POSIX libs.

## Install

### Linux/Unix:

Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuXYIO/LRDemo
```

Compile:

```
cd LRDemo
make
```

The make process might interfere with python venv's libs like numpy, so please create those after using make, I have no idea how to ignore the venv files in make.

### Windows:

Not supported yet.  
With versions including and after commit `7bbfc08c43ca8c24be9d7da5e21884a420c4fa7a`, the program uses POSIX libs, which vanilla Windows doesn't support. The versions before might have a chance of working on Windows.  
Might work if using methods like MinGW to use POSIX standards on Windows.

## Usage

```bash
./LR [options]
```

### Args

See manual:

```bash
./LR -h
```

### Other

1. **./stat/plot.py**  
   A simple plot python program for plotting the CSV formatted file that can be outputted by LR using `-f` option (see Args).  
   Note that it needs `matplotlib` and `pandas` lib to work.  
   More info in plot.py's first multiline comment.
2. **./stat/multiplot.py**  
   A version of plot.py, but shows two set of CSV formatted file merged into one plot, doesn't show gradient information.  
   More info in multiplot.py's first multiline comment.

#### Usage

Create a python virtual env

```bash
cd stat
python3 -m venv myenv
source ./myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

./plot.py data.csv
```

the `data.csv` is generated by the `LR` main program with `-f datafilename` option.  
Python tkinter might be needed for matplotlib.

## Technical Details

### Algorithms

Loss function: `MSE`  
Regression algorithm: `Gradient decent`  
Random algorithm: `Box-muller normal distro`

### Functions

**f(x)**: Training function, for training  
**g(x)**: Data function, for generating training data

## Purpose

A project to help improve C programming skills and understand neural networks better.
