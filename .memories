Actually the original code of this project was lost. Back then, I don't use git, and mistakenly deleted this project. Luckily, I was able to rebuild it from my memory in a short time (the code back then isn't too complicated), and I eventually started to use git.
I also remember that I skipped a whole physics class to calculate the formula for gradient descent, MSE, no activation function for single neuron. It was really exciting.
