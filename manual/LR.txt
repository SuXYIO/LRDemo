INPUT
	Inputting strings: 
		When inputting a string with blank chars to the prompt, like in shells, use " or ' to cover it. 
		When inputting " or ' inside a string, use \" or \'. (can use ' in ", can use " in ')
		Example: 
			"foo 'bar' \"baz\"" will be interpreted to  foo 'bar' "baz"
	Command history: 
		The program will store commands (that's not blank) to memory. When pressing the "Up" key in the prompt, go up one history, down one history when pressing the "Down" key. 
		These two keys only work when lenth of input is 0. 
		The histsize (max numbers of histories to store) is defined by CMDHISTSIZE macro in main.h. 
		Note that this is only in memory, will not be saved after the program closes. 
	Command prompt: 
		The command prompt string is defined by PROMPT macro in main.h.
