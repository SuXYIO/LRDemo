tr/train [args]
	Auto training. 
	Options: 
		-V	Verbose mode, prints values of vars every iteration. 
		-t	Thread mode, enable muti-thread. Might increase calculation speed if batch_size is large. 
			Not recommended, decreases speed most of the time. 
			Max thread numbers is defined by the MAX_THREADS macro in main.h. 
		-f [filename]	Write info per iteration to a file, in CSV format. Creates one if file doesn't exist, ask if overwrite if it does. 
		-p [precision]
			Define how many numbers to print after decimal point for floats and doubles. 
			The default value is defined in main.h FPP macro. 
		-A [funcnum]	Define which activation function to use, 0 is default. 
			funcnum:
				0: None
				1: ReLU
				2: LeakyReLU
				3: Sigmoid
				4: Tanh
		-L [funcnum]	Define which loss function to use, 0 is default. 
			funcnum:
				0: MSE
		-b [batchsize]	Define how large is one batch (batch_size), 256 is default. 
		-e [eta]	Define eta (learning rate), 0.001 is default. 
		-l [expectedloss]	Define expected loss, the training ends when loss < expectedloss, 0.0001 is default.
